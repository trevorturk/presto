# get remote mysql db locally
# consider deleting spam comments, emptying the trash, dropping unnecessary tables, etc
mysqldump -u USERNAME -p -h HOST DATABASE > dumpfile
mysql -u USERNAME -p DATABASE < dumpfile

# send remote mysql db to heroku to convert to postgres
# you may have to fix some db errors, for example:
# mysql> update wp_comments set comment_date_gmt = comment_date where comment_date_gmt is null;
# consider deleting revisions of posts to keep db size down
# mysql> delete from wp_posts where post_type = 'revision';
mate config/database.yml # make development db point to local mysql db
heroku db:push
# if the encoding is messed up, check out the "taps" gem docs, maybe you need to use "latin1"

# todo...

# now
redirect ae to tt with ae heroku rack app
no-www middleware for ae & tt
once planet rails gets back, redirect old feedburner url

# later
page through old content and fix up and messed up posts
shut down asmallorange
projects in sidebar
search in sidebar
allow new comments (w/ akismet support)
atompub or xmlrpc

# ideas
use wp_options for all hard-coded stuff
move feed outside of theme
try to get post comments going through active record associations
deny access to erb files in public
google alerts or rfrlz instead of mint
archives, recent posts
contributors (buddies like max, nick, etc)
postrank top posts widget
auto link urls in comments

gemify presto
prefer, for example, single.erb to index.erb if available for posts/show
catch common wp post routes (/?p=123 etc)
catch legacy page routes /page/2/
catch not_found
catch errors
