# get remote mysql db locally
mysqldump -u USERNAME -p -h HOST DATABASE > dumpfile

# todo
/feed/
feedburner
tt heroku app with ae db
redirect ae to tt with ae heroku rack app
no-www middleware for ae & tt

# later
page through old content and fix up and messed up posts
shut down asmallorange
projects in sidebar
search (with google?)
atompub or xmlrpc
allow new comments (w/ akismet support)
use wp_options for all hard-coded stuff

# maybe
deny access to erb files in public
google alerts or rfrlz instead of mint
archives, recent posts
contributors (buddies like max, nick, etc)
postrank top posts widget
auto link urls in comments

# perhaps
http://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra-activerecord (mysql?)
gemify presto

# ideas
prefer, for example, single.erb to index.erb if available for posts/show
catch common wp post routes (/?p=123 etc)
catch legacy page routes /page/2/
catch not_found
catch errors
